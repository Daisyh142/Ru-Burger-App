# RU Burger Android App

RU Burger is an Android application developed for CS213 at Rutgers University. The app allows users to place customized food orders for burgers, sandwiches, beverages, sides, and combo meals.

Users can choose bread types, proteins, and add-ons for burgers and sandwiches. They can also select drink flavors, side items, sizes, and quantities.

Each item includes a real-time price update, and combo meals come with a sandwich, side, and drink.

The app includes multiple screens for ordering different items, viewing the current order, and checking past orders. Users can add or remove items and see the order total with sales tax.

The app uses various Android components such as Activities, RecyclerView, ListView, Spinner, Toast, AlertDialog, and ImageView.

This app was developed and tested using Android Studio and runs on a Pixel 3a XL emulator with API level 34.
